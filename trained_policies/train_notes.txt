2: brax PPO, converted humanoid env, left settings on default

3:  reward weight changes:
    ctrl_cost_weight=0.5 -> 0.2,
    forward_reward_weight=1.0 -> 2.0,
    vertical_reward_weight=0.5 -> 1.0

4: 30mil timesteps

5: changed vel_x to pos_x in reward, 5mil timesteps

6: revert to vel_x, restrict wrist joints, weaken all actuators 5x (100->20), better starting pose

7: add reward_lowvel: -1/vel (encourage movement)

8: reward_lowvel_weight 1.0 -> 0.1

9: reward_lowvel_weight 0.1 -> 0.01 (still matters cause asymptotic), reward_ctrl_weight 0.2 -> 0.05

10: lowvel weight = 0

11: 20m timesteps

12: fwd reward 2.0 -> -3.0, alive reward 1.0 -> 0.5

12.5: add angle constraints - didn't work, removed

13: fwd reward -3.0 -> -2.0, healthy height 0.15 -> 0.19

14: vert_reward 1.0 -> 0.2

improvement ideas:
different policy - not needed at this stage
better starting pose
less powerful motors
reward edits
simplify meshes for faster runtime
