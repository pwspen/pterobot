2: brax PPO, converted humanoid env, left settings on default

3:  reward weight changes:
    ctrl_cost_weight=0.5 -> 0.2,
    forward_reward_weight=1.0 -> 2.0,
    vertical_reward_weight=0.5 -> 1.0

4: 30mil timesteps

5: changed vel_x to pos_x in reward, 5mil timesteps

different policy
better starting pose
less powerful motors
reward edits
simplify meshes for faster runtime
