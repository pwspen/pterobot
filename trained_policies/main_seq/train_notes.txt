2: brax PPO, converted humanoid env, left settings on default

3:  reward weight changes:
    ctrl_cost_weight=0.5 -> 0.2,
    forward_reward_weight=1.0 -> 2.0,
    vertical_reward_weight=0.5 -> 1.0

4: 30mil timesteps

5: changed vel_x to pos_x in reward, 5mil timesteps

6: revert to vel_x, restrict wrist joints, weaken all actuators 5x (100->20), better starting pose

improvement ideas:
different policy - not needed at this stage
better starting pose
less powerful motors
reward edits
simplify meshes for faster runtime
