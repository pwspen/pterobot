I made a simplified model of a pterosaur and trained it using reinforcement learning. I used Mujoco, Brax (with MJX) and JAX. Included in this repo are the actual training script to run on Google Colab (Pterobot_Train.ipynb) and various other utility scripts.

This was the final project in a machine learning class.

I aim to pick this back up at some point to actually get a nice walking gait, instead of the current best result I got, [which is head-walking.](https://synapsomorphy.com/headwalk.html)
